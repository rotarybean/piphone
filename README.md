Convert a wall-mount rotary phone into a vintage-voice recorder with web interface

Hello, I'm @rotarybean!
I'm a hobbyist software developer and professional IT administrator.  
Long story short, my brother came to me, asking if we could come up with a creative way for guests to make best-wishes messages using a "vintage" (damn I feel old) wall-mounted rotary phone and a RaspberryPi 3B+. 

Behold, the PiPhone!  You'll need the following items:

Line-powered rotary phone
RaspberryPi 3/3B/+/4
Supported USB Microphone
5v Power Supply (a 5v 2A batter pack is used for this project)

Keep an eye on README.md as this project will start at a baseline of simple function (audio record, store, web UI) and gain capabilities such as rotary menu interface, functioning ringer, etc.
